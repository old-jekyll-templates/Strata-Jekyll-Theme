## Everybody in your lab writes his results down in a lab notebook looking like this? Then you should read on!

Every researcher needs to document his results. For decades and generations of researchers used a simple notebook which achieved its purpose just fine. But nowadays it seems kind of awkward that many researchers still use paper-based lab notebooks (PLN) for documentation of their research. We live in a time where everybody uses smartphones or other electronic helpers. Hence the question arises why those paper-based lab notebooks still exist, although there is a wide collection of electronic lab notebooks (ELN) available. <!--more-->

## Differences and similarities between paper-based and electronic lab notebooks

To get in touch with the topic the following table shall provide an overview on some characteristics regarding both types of documentation.

| | Paper-based | Electronic |
|-|-----|-----|
| Flexibility | Everything you can draw, write or stick in it is possible | Flexible to a certain degree, dependent on the programming
| Price | Cheap a few dollars per book | A infrastructure is needed, also service plans or hosting can cost a lot
| Safety | Otherwise you scan the whole book there is no backup possibility. On the other hand nobody without physical access can read what you have written down  |  As to be expected it is pretty easy to backup a ELN, but by the use of a network based system intrusion is theoretically possible. Also you should invest whether the kind of your data can be hosted on the servers you use

In summary, PLNs are cheap and flexible in their usage but not very safe nor searchable. ELNs on the other hand range from free to expensive while they are just as flexible as the programing of the software. But you can easily search all your experiments, in most cases also the experiments of your team or institution. This can give an advance in collaboration and teamwork but besides this it can add some level of control and quality management. It seems easier to introduce standard operating procedures and progress control via a digital system with access over the network. Also electronic data is easy to backup, so the risk of data loss gets lower. Regarding legal aspects both systems can be a safe solution to prove your intellectual property, but the digital need some setup to suffice the requirements. 

## The electronic lab notebook (ELN) landscape

Still it remains not comprehensible why PLNs are favored by most researches. Therefore we should take a look at possible electronic solutions available. To get a basic overview I recommend the blog post by Luka Zupančič about [the 7 Best Electronic Lab Notebooks (ELN) Review for Your Research](http://splice-bio.com/the-7-best-electronic-lab-notebooks-eln-for-your-research/) or this [list on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ELN_software_packages). Because I followed this topic since a while I already did know Luka Zupančičs winner [Scinote](http://scinote.net/), which was on the other hand not at all surprising because its from the company he works for. I do not want to impute evil's sake, but at least a commercial interest. Although Scinote is advertised as open source and also crowdfunded on Kickstarter the first days after launch you could not find any code. After all I have the impression that they mostly focus on selling their service plans and not on providing a open-source ELN like their Kickstarter campaign insinuated. Last time I checked at least I could find a link to [their Github repository](https://github.com/biosistemika/scinote-web). I came to the conclusion that there are many competing companies out there who try to sell you their ELN by all necessary means.

But what a the new generation of researchers really wants is something different. The movements in science that propagate openscience and open-source are emerging and fast growing. Those researchers need a lab notebook which is in line with the times (electronic) and also free and open-source. Fortunately I found one other ELN which seems to fulfill all this needs. Thus I would like to introduce to you [elabFTW](http://www.elabftw.net/). 

## elabFTW

[ElabFTW](http://www.elabftw.net/) is a server based ELN which is programmed and maintained by Nicolas Carpi. One thing I like really about elabFTW is its license. It uses [AGPL](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html) which [guarantees](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/agpl-3.0/) you a real open source access to all of its components. 

You can easily check out a working system in a [live demo](https://demo.elabftw.net/login.php). The elegance of elabFTW lies in its simplicity. It is as flexible and easy to use as a white blank page. But on top of this comes a sophisticated pack of features that are making your researcher life easier. And this is exactly what one will hope for by change over to an ELN.

## Conclusion

Most certainly everyone has different needs and expectations towards an ELN. In my opinion elabFTW poses as a very good and flexible solution but others may judge differently. Finally I am pretty sure that the ELN that suits your purpose can be found already today. That is why you should pick your solution but pick one which is up-to-date.
