## Does your lab notebook look like this? Then you should read on!

Sometimes it seems kind of awkward that many researchers still use paper based lab notebooks for documentation of their research. We live in a time where everybody uses smartphones or other electronic helpers. So I asked myself the question why do those paper lab notebooks (PLN) still exist, while there is a wide collection of electronic lab notebooks (ELN) available? My explanation of the how and why and a introduction to #openscience solutions follows in the next lines. <!--more-->

## Differences and similarities between paper-based and electronic lab notebooks

To get an idea of the differences of both the following table shall regard some details.

| | paper-based lab notebook (PLN) | electronic lab notebook (ELN) |
|-|-----|-----|
| Flexibility | Everything you can draw, write or stick in it is possible | Flexible to a certain degree, dependent on the programming
| Price | Cheap a few dollars per book | A infrastructure is needed, also service plans or hosting can cost a lot
| Safety | Otherwise you scan the whole book there is no backup possibility. On the other hand nobody without physical access can read what you have written down  |  As to be expected it is pretty easy to backup a ELN, but by the use of a network based system intrusion is theoretically possible. Also you should invest whether the kind of your data can be hosted on the servers you use
| Search ability | If you are conscientiously care of a register | Easy search all your Experiments
| Legal aspects | As written down | If supported by the used ELN

So to sum up, PLNs are cheap and flexible in their usage but not very safe nor searchable. ELNs on the other hand range from free to expensive while they are just as flexible as the programing of the software. But you can easily search all your experiments, in most cases also the experiments of your team or institution. Also electronic data is easy to backup, so the risk of dataloss gets lower. Regarding legal aspects both systems can be a safe solution to prove your intellectual property.

## The electronic lab notebook (ELN) landscape

While doing my research on possible ELN Solutions I came across a blog post by [splice-bio.com](http://splice-bio.com/) about [the 7 Best Electronic Lab Notebooks (ELN) Review for Your Research](http://splice-bio.com/the-7-best-electronic-lab-notebooks-eln-for-your-research/). Because I was following this topic since a while I already did know their winner [Scinote](http://scinote.net/), which was on the other hand not at all surprising because it is the same company. I do not want to impute evil's sake, but at least a commercial interest. Although Scinote is advertised as open source and also crowdfunded on Kickstarter the first days after launch you could not find any code. After all I have the impression that they mostly focus on selling their service plans and not on providing a open source ELN like their Kickstarter campaign insinuated. Last time I checked at least I could find a link to [their Github repository](https://github.com/biosistemika/scinote-web). I came to the conclusion that there are many competing companies out there who try to sell you their ELN. It seems to be a growing market, which includes that they try to convince you by all necessary means.

But lets have a look back on their blog post. While all of the tested solutions have a free plan none of them seems to be real open source. Gladly I found one other ELN which seems to fulfill all my needs and is open source. Therefore I like to introduce to you [elabFTW](http://www.elabftw.net/). I will show you why I think it is the only real open source solution out there and why I choose it over other ELNs.
