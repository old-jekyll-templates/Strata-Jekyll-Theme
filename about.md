title: About me
---

I am a medical student at University of Greifswald and working on my doctors's degree (Dr. med.) at the Department of Pharmacology and the Department of Neurosurgery.  I am running research on the malignant brain tumor glioblastoma multiforme, while following my interests in versatile topics like statistics and data science, openscience, reproducible research, ethics and philosophy.
